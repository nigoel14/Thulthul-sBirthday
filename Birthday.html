    <p> This is your final 25th Gift!! Love! I am so glad.. Hopefully, I might have succeeded <br>a bit in making your
        25 th birthday a better one. On this day I wanna wish you <br>alot of luck and success ahead. I cannot promise
        you the moon but yes I promise <br> to make the coming year more memorable for you. I might not be physically
        present there <br> but yes I am all there with you celebrating the birthday of my best friend and my man.
        <br> You are my thul thul on whom I can blindly rely upon. Thank you for tolerating me for these<br> many years
        Ha ha ! Indeed many more to come. Today I wanna burden you with one more <br>responsibility ha ha of loving me
        more and always and Fight less, which is I know <br>very difficult for you but you can try at least! Moreover, I
        want a party!❤️❤️ We all love you!!<br>
        (PS : You will get this sketch of yours after corona!)
